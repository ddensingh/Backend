# HashMap Implementation in JAVA

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a **HashMap** (also known as a Hash Table) in Python. The code demonstrates how HashMap works, including various methods and functions for inserting, retrieving, and manipulating key-value pairs.

HashMap is a fundamental data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations, all typically with an average time complexity of O(1).

### Concepts Explained

The code implementation explains and demonstrates the following methods and functions related to the HashMap concept:

1. **`put(key, value)`** - Inserts or updates a key-value pair in the HashMap.
2. **`get(key)`** - Retrieves the value associated with the given key.
3. **`remove(key)`** - Removes the key-value pair with the specified key.
4. **`contains_key(key)`** - Checks if a key is present in the HashMap.
5. **`size()`** - Returns the number of key-value pairs in the HashMap.
6. **`hash_function(key)`** - Computes the hash value for the given key.
7. **`resize()`** - Resizes the underlying array to maintain optimal load factor and prevent performance degradation.
